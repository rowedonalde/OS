  <h1>
    The Modern Lady or Gentleman's Guide to Modifying, Building, and Installing
    a new Kernel for Ubuntu 11.10
  </h1>
  
  <h2>
    Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Computer or virtual machine running Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)</li>
    <li>
      The following should be a part of the Ubuntu 11.10 distribution, but you
      should check to make sure that they are present:
      <ol>
        <li><span class="bash">git</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">make</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gcc</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">dkpg</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The <span class="bash">fakeroot</span> package</li>
    <li>The <span class="bash">kernel-package</span> package</li>
    <li>The <span class="bash">libncurses5-dev</span> package</li>
    <li>root privileges</li>
    <li>An Internet connection (Still gotta say it...)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Step 1: Download the kernel sources</h2>
  <p>
    Ubuntu maintains the sources to their versions of the Linux kernel at
    ubuntu.kernel.org. Move into a desired directory (I use 
    <span class="bash">~/git-repos</span>, where <span class="bash">~</span> is
    my home directory) and clone in the most recent version of the kernel with
    the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-oneiric.git
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    This should generate a new directory called
    <span class="bash">ubuntu-oneiric</span>
    containing all of the sources for the kernel. Sit tight, since the
    kernel comprises a considerably large volume of code and will take an
    accordingly decent length of time to download.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 2: Configure and build the plain kernel</h2>
  <p>
    To get a feel for how to build a new kernel from source before you
    complicate things with your modification, you should first practice
    building the one you cloned. As with building most projects from source,
    there are three parts to this process: configuring, cleaning, and building.
    All three of these parts are done from the root directory of the project
    (in my case, <span class="bash">~/git-repos/ubuntu-oneiric</span>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To configure the build with the graphic prompt, use the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    make menuconfig
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Unless you have some reason to make adjustments to the default settings (I
    didn't, and you probably shouldn't either), just select "Exit." Once the
    build finishes configuring, clean up the tree with the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    make-kpkg clean
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Since you presumably haven't compiled anything yet, there shouldn't be
    much, if anything, to clean. Regardless, it's a pretty quick process. Once
    that's done, it's time to build! To do so, use the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-test kernel_image kernel_headers
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    So far, the commands you've given to the terminal have been pretty simple.
    This one, though, is considerably more complicated, so let's break it down
    for everybody's edification and general well-being. As with the previous
    command to clean the build tree, this command, is a part of the
    <span class="bash">make-kpkg</span> utility which, per its manpage,
    "is used to create the kernel related Debian packages." The command before
    <span class="bash">make-kpkg</span>, <span class="bash">fakeroot</span>, is
    similar to <span class="bash">sudo</span> in that it grants what appears to
    be root privileges for a process. Unlike <span class="bash">sudo</span>,
    though, this command only offers a subset of commands that appear to act
    as root and are
    <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9714/what-is-the-need-for-fakeroot-command-in-linux">
    helpful for when such commands are necessary but the user may not
    necessarily have root permissions</a>. The option 
    <span class="bash">--initrd</span> specifies to create an 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initial ramdisk</a>,
    necessary for booting the system with a given kernel. The option
    <span class="bash">--append-to-version</span> allows you to append a string
    to the end of the version name of your kernel. Even though this version of
    the kernel source is likely different from that of the kernel that came
    with your distribution of Ubuntu, it's a wise idea to attach a name to
    identify this build&mdash;especially since you'll be building a modified
    version later! The last two pieces of the command,
    <span class="bash">kernel_image</span> and
    <span class="bash">kernel_headers</span>, specify that a Debian packages of
    the kernel binary and its C headers should be created. Once you've called
    this command in the terminal, sit back&mdash;it will take awhile,
    especially if you're like me and you're running it in a VM with 512MB of
    RAM allotted.
