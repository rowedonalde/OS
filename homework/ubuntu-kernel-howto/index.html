  <h1>
    The Modern Lady or Gentleman's Guide to Modifying, Building, and Installing
    a new Kernel for Ubuntu 11.10
  </h1>
  
  <h2>
    Prerequisites
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Computer or virtual machine running Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)</li>
    <li>
      The following should be a part of the Ubuntu 11.10 distribution, but you
      should check to make sure that they are present:
      <ol>
        <li><span class="bash">git</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">make</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gcc</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">dkpg</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gedit</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The <span class="bash">fakeroot</span> package</li>
    <li>The <span class="bash">kernel-package</span> package</li>
    <li>The <span class="bash">libncurses5-dev</span> package</li>
    <li>root privileges</li>
    <li>An Internet connection (Still gotta say it...)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Step 1: Download the kernel sources</h2>
  <p>
    Ubuntu maintains the sources to their versions of the Linux kernel at
    ubuntu.kernel.org. Move into a desired directory (I use 
    <span class="bash">~/git-repos</span>, where <span class="bash">~</span> is
    my home directory) and clone in the most recent version of the kernel with
    the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-oneiric.git
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    This should generate a new directory called
    <span class="bash">ubuntu-oneiric</span>
    containing all of the sources for the kernel. Sit tight, since the
    kernel comprises a considerably large volume of code and will take an
    accordingly decent length of time to download.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 2: Configure and build the plain kernel</h2>
  <p>
    To get a feel for how to build a new kernel from source before you
    complicate things with your modification, you should first practice
    building the one you cloned. As with building most projects from source,
    there are three parts to this process: configuring, cleaning, and building.
    All three of these parts are done from the root directory of the project
    (in my case, <span class="bash">~/git-repos/ubuntu-oneiric</span>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To configure the build with the graphic prompt, use the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    make menuconfig
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Unless you have some reason to make adjustments to the default settings (I
    didn't, and you probably shouldn't either), just select "Exit." Once the
    build finishes configuring, clean up the tree with the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    make-kpkg clean
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Since you presumably haven't compiled anything yet, there shouldn't be
    much, if anything, to clean. Regardless, it's a pretty quick process. Once
    that's done, it's time to build! To do so, use the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-test kernel_image kernel_headers
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    So far, the commands you've given to the terminal have been pretty simple.
    This one, though, is considerably more complicated, so let's break it down
    for everybody's edification and general well-being. As with the previous
    command to clean the build tree, this command, is a part of the
    <span class="bash">make-kpkg</span> utility which, per its manpage,
    "is used to create the kernel related Debian packages." The command before
    <span class="bash">make-kpkg</span>, <span class="bash">fakeroot</span>, is
    similar to <span class="bash">sudo</span> in that it grants what appears to
    be root privileges for a process. Unlike <span class="bash">sudo</span>,
    though, this command only offers a subset of commands that appear to act
    as root and are
    <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9714/what-is-the-need-for-fakeroot-command-in-linux">
    helpful for when such commands are necessary but the user may not
    necessarily have root permissions</a>. The option 
    <span class="bash">--initrd</span> specifies to create an 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initial ramdisk</a>,
    necessary for booting the system with a given kernel. The option
    <span class="bash">--append-to-version</span> allows you to append a string
    to the end of the version name of your kernel. Even though this version of
    the kernel source is likely different from that of the kernel that came
    with your distribution of Ubuntu, it's a wise idea to attach a name to
    identify this build&mdash;especially since you'll be building a modified
    version later! The last two pieces of the command,
    <span class="bash">kernel_image</span> and
    <span class="bash">kernel_headers</span>, specify that a Debian packages of
    the kernel binary and its C headers should be created. Once you've called
    this command in the terminal, sit back&mdash;it will take awhile,
    especially if you're like me and you're running it in a VM with 512MB of
    RAM allotted.

  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 3: Install the newly built packages</h2>
  <p>
    Once the kernel has finished building, <span class="bash">cd</span> up to
    the directory above the root of the
    <span class="bash">ubuntu-oneiric</span> repo (that is,
    <span class="bash">~/git-repos</span> if you've been following along). You
    should be able to see the build product: 2 .deb files, one beginning with
    <span class="bash">linux-headers</span> and the other beginning with
    <span class="bash">linux-image</span>. As a derivative of the Debian
    distribution of
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=kZlOCHYu1Vk#t=170s">Linux</a>,
    Ubuntu uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg">Debian package
    management system</a> to handle distribution and installation of software
    packages, in this case the image and headers of your newly built Linux
    kernel. To install the kernel, use the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    sudo dpkg -i *.deb
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Once the kernel packages finish installing successfully, move them
    somewhere for safe keeping&mdash;you'll want them out of the way when you
    build and install future kernels.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 4: Configure GRUB</h2>
  <p>
    Ubuntu uses <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2">GRUB 2</a>
    to boot the kernel and load the operating system. As a system can have any
    number of kernels from which it can choose to load (yours now has at least
    two!), GRUB 2 must be configured to load the newly compiled kernel. First,
    though, check the version of GRUB that you have with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    grub-install -v
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    The program should respond with something like:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    grub-install (GRUB) 1.99-12ubuntu5
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    As long as yours is at least 1.98, you're in good shape; otherwise, get
    yourself a new version, as the following instructions won't make any sense!
    (Yes, GRUB 2 technically started at GRUB 1.98. The biggest critical
    difference from a user standpoint is the configuration process.) First,
    open the GRUB 2 configuration file in Gedit 
    (<a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">or whatever, it's up to you</a>)
    with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    On line 7 or thereabouts, you should find an uncommented (that is, the one
    without a # character in front of it) option that says
    <span class="bash">GRUB_DEFAULT</span>. Assuming you appended the string
    <span class="bash">-test</span> when you build the kernel, change that
    option to:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    GRUB_DEFAULT="Ubuntu, with Linux 3.0.22-test+"
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Once you've brought that in, save and quit Gedit. To make the new
    configuration official, call the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    sudo update-grub
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Step 5: Restart your machine</h2>
  <p>Just do this ^</p>
  
  <h2>Step 6: Check your kernel version</h2>
  
  <p>
    Once your machine is back on and you're logged back in, check the version
    of the kernel to make sure that the install went through okay and that the
    new kernel is actually booted:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    uname -r
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    The terminal should respond with <span class="bash">3.0.22-test+</span> (or
    whatever you chose for the <span class="bash">--append-to-version</span> if
    you didn't choose <span class="bash">test</span>). If the command responds
    with the name of the kernel you just built, congratulations! You have
    successfully built and deployed a new Linux kernel from scratch. If not,
    well, go check over your output history&mdash;as long as everything
    appeared to go well with building, perhaps there's a confusion with GRUB.
    (You <em>did</em> run <span class="bash">grub-update</span>, didn't you?)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once you've fixed any heartbreaking disasters, it's time for the big
    leagues&mdash;modifying the kernel with a custom system call.
    <img src="http://sywh.freeforums.org/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" />
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 7: Add the source file for the new system call</h2>
  
  <p>
    First, a little note:
    <a href="http://enzam.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/how-to-add-a-system-call-in-linux-kernel-ubuntu-os/">A
    lot of people like to specify the new system call in the headers first.</a>
    I, on the other hand, like to get my hands dirty with the actual coding.
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Etymology">To each their
    own, I suppose.</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have any business at all even peeking into the Linux kernel, much
    less building it at home for fun and/or profit, chances are you're a huge
    big-shot computer programmer guy by this point. Well, Mr. Big-shot, put
    your nostalgia shoes on, since we're taking a ride back to Hello World!
    town&mdash;for your first kernel mod, you'll be writing a system call that
    writes <span class="bash">hello World!</span> to the kernel log file
    <span class="bash">/var/log/kern.log</span>.
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-kernel-logging-apis/index.html">Fun
    fact: the library you will be using to write to the kernel log is used not
    just in Linux, but across many different types of kernels, *nix and
    otherwise.</a> To add the code for the new call,
    <span class="bash">cd</span> back to your
    <span class="bash">ubuntu-oneiric</span> directory and open up a new file,
    <span class="bash">kernel/helloworld.c</span>. To that new file, add the
    following code:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    #include <linux/linkage.h>
    #include <linux/kernel.h>
    asmlinkage int sys_helloworld()
    {
        printk(KERN_EMERG "hello world!");
        
        return 1;
    }
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    What we have is a pretty short chunk of C code&mdash;it <em>is</em> a Hello
    World, after all. As it's the ever-laconic C, though, each piece packs
    quite a punch. First, we see two header includes,
    <span class="bash">#include &lt;linux/linkage.h&gt;</span> and
    <span class="bash">#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;</span>, which,
    respectively, specify the <span class="bash">asmlinkage</span>
    preprocessor macro and <span class="bash">printk()</span> prototype per
    <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/linkage.h?v=3.0">Linux
    Cross-Reference</a>. The <span class="bash">asmlinkage</span> macro
    specifes that the following kernel function is to be read as pure C, not
    C++. The <span class="bash">printk()</span> calls a function
    that writes to kernel logs, and the <span class="bash">KERN_EMERG</span>
    macro specifies that <span class="bash">printk()</span> should print the
    message as a signal of complete system failure (though, if you lean toward
    the less dramatic, there is a whole list from which you can choose
    <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/printk.h?v=3.0">listed
    here</a>). <span class="bash">sys_helloworld()</span> is, of course, the
    name of your system call function. Now that you've got your source code
    written up, let's hook it into the kernel.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Step 8: Add your system call to the system call table and register its
    syscall number
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    System calls are incredibly low-level constructs, so they must be
    <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-4.html">accessed by number,
    not directly by their more-or-less-human-readable names</a>. Furthermore,
    they are numbered based on their order in the system call table, found in
    <span class="bash">arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S</span>. (The
    <span class="bash">x86</span> may be different depending on your
    processor.) To add your
    system call to the table, open up that file a text editor and move all the
    way to the bottom. On a new last line, add the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    .long sys_helloworld
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Note the number of your system call&mdash;in my case, it was 347, but the
    syscall table should be commented every few lines with a marker, the last
    of which you can use to determine your system call's number.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, you need to register your system call number as a macro and update
    the total number of system calls. Assuming that you're still running a
    32-bit system, open the file
    <span class="bash">arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_32.h</span> in a text
    editor. After the opening comment, you should see a big long list of macro
    definitions starting with <span class="bash">__NR</span>, each of which
    indicates a system call number. After the last of these definitions, that
    is, before the line that says <span class="bash">#ifdef __KERNEL__</span>,
    add the following line:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    #define __NR_helloworld         347
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    System call numbers and the number of system calls that exist fluctuates;
    your system call should be one more than the last one above it, so it may
    be different than mine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, you need to update the number of system calls by simply incrementing
    <span class="bash">#define NR_syscalls</span>. That is, if it currently
    says
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    #define NR_syscalls 347
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    you should change it to
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    #define NR_syscalls 348
  </pre>
  
  <h2>
    Step 9: Add your system call to the syscall interface header
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    In order to share functions across different C programs,
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Header-Files.html">they need to
    be declared in header files</a>. Functions that represent system calls
    in particular need to be declared as an interface that user mode programs
    can access them through. In your repo, use a text editor to open the file
    <span class="bash">include/linux/syscalls.h</span>. Scroll down to the
    bottom of the file. Right above the <span class="bash">#endif</span>
    statement at the end of the file, add the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void);
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Note that the function prototype is specified as taking a void parameter.
    Even if your function takes no arguments,
    <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/DCL20-C.+Always+specify+void+even+if+a+function+accepts+no+arguments">it's
    best practice to specify a void "parameter" in your protoype</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 10: Add your system call source file to the Makefile</h2>
  
  <p>
    I bet you're champing at the bit to build this kernel for real at this
    point&mdash;well, hold your horses, since there's one more step, and it
    brings us full circle around the kernel mod racetrack (sorry if that last
    one was a bit of a stretch). As with any project built with
    <span class="bash">make</span>, you need to register your new files in the
    relevant Makefile. Once again, take your trusty text editor and open up the
    Makefile in the same directory as the added source file, in this case,
    <span class="bash">kernel/Makefile</span>. (As you're probably aware,
    files don't <em>need</em> comma-delimited extensions in Linux; also, be
    sure to mind the capital <em>M</em>>.) Beneath the opening comment, you
    should see a <span class="bash">make</span> instruction with the name
    <span class="bash">obj-y</span>. At the end of that instruction, add the
    name of the eventual object file generated from your system call source
    file, that is, <span class="bash">helloworld.o</span>. So, the whole
    definition should look close to the following, depending on the other
    source files that may or may not be in that directory:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    obj-y     = sched.o fork.o exec_domain.o panic.o printk.o \
                cpu.o exit.o itimer.o time.o softirq.o resource.o \
                sysctl.o sysctl_binary.o capability.o ptrace.o timer.o user.o \
                signal.o sys.o kmod.o workqueue.o pid.o \
                rcupdate.o extable.o params.o posix-timers.o \
                kthread.o wait.o kfifo.o sys_ni.o posix-cpu-timers.o mutex.o \
                hrtimer.o rwsem.o nsproxy.o srcu.o semaphore.o \
                notifier.o ksysfs.o pm_qos_params.o sched_clock.o cred.o \
                async.o range.o jump_label.o helloworld.o
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Once that file is added to the list, it's time for the real deal.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 11: Build, deploy, and verify your newly modified kernel</h2>
  
  <p>
    Well, we're right back where we started&mdash;albeit this time, we've got
    a new system call in tow. Simply (heh) repeat steps 2 through 6 to build,
    deploy, and verify the booting of your kernel mod. The only difference is
    the name: before when you specified the kernel tag
    <span class="bash">-test</span>, you'll want to pick
    <span class="bash">-helloworld</span> to differentiate this build from the
    previous one. See you on the other side...
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 12: Write and compile a program to demonstrate your system call</h2>
  
  <p>
    If you've reached this point, it means you've successfully built and
    installed your kernel, and that you've verified that the new kernel is
    actually running your machine right now. Now that that's the case, it's
    time to see what your new system call can do (spoiler: not a whole lot, but
    it gets the point across). To execute your system call, call the C function
    <span class="bash">syscall(syscallnumber)</span> where
    <span class="bash">syscallnumber</span> is your system call's number. Thus,
    your program should look like the following:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    /**
     * sys_hello_caller.c
     *
     * This program demonstrates the use of the helloworld system call in the
     * 3.0.22-helloworld+ kernel fork.
     */

    #define __NR_helloworld 347

    //Invoke the newly defined helloworld system call which prints "hello, world!"
    //to the kernel log file /var/log/kern.log:
    
    main()
    {
        syscall(__NR_helloworld);
    }
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    To compile this program with the name
    <span class="bash">sys_hello_caller</span>, <span class="bash">cd</span> to
    the directory where you saved the program (anywhere you have privileges,
    really) and call the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    gcc -o sys_hello_caller sys_hello_caller.c
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Step 13: Run your system call and verify that it works</h2>
