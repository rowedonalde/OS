1. The cd command gets special command in this assignment because there is no
   dedicated executable cd--cd is just a special command that tells bash to
   call the POSIX API function chdir(). Since cd is not a program in the system
   mysh has to look for it as a special case of input.

2. mysh can run a script so long as there is a separate executable like python,
   perl, or even bash to do so--mysh just specifies the interpreter in the
   first command and the script and possible arguments afterward. As for
   scripts like those that bash runs, mysh cannot run these independently. mysh
   would need to have extra specialized parsing built in to handle *.sh
   scripts.
