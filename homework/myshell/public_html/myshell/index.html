    The Modern Lady or Gentleman's Guide to Building and Installing mysh on
    Ubuntu 11.10
  </h1>
  
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Computer or virtual machine running Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)
      <br/>(Preferably running the kernel mod described in
      <a href="http://my.cs.lmu.edu/~drowe2/ubuntu-kernel-howto/">
      The Modern Lady or Gentleman's Guide to Modifying, Building, and
      Installing a new Kernel for Ubuntu 11.10</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      The following should be a part of the Ubuntu 11.10 distribution, but you
      should check to make sure that they are present:
      <ol>
        <li>A browser of some kind</li>
        <li><span class="bash">git</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gcc</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gedit</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>root privileges</li>
    <li>An Internet connection (Still gotta say it...)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Step 1: Download the mysh source</h2>
  <p>
    Open the page
    <a href="mysh.c">
    here</a>, which has the full source
    file for <span class="bash">mysh</span>. Save this file in a directory
    where you are allowed to build and execute it&mdash;for our purposes, let's
    save it in a new directory <span class="bash">~/mysh</span>, where
    <span class="bash">~</span> is your home directory.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 2: Compile mysh from source</h2>
  <p>
    Open up your terminal and <span class="bash">cd</span> to
    <span class="bash">~/mysh</span> (or wherever you saved the source file
    from Step 1). Build an executable with the name
    <span class="bash">mysh</span> with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    gcc -o mysh mysh.c
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Unlike when you perhaps built the modified kernel from source with
    <span class="bash">make</span>, here you use <span class="bash">gcc</span>
    alone. The combination of the argument and option
    <span class="bash">-o mysh</span> tell <span class="bash">gcc</span> to
    name the resulting executable <span class="bash">mysh</span>. Without this
    statement, the compiler will choose the name
    <span class="bash">a.out</span> by default,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out">a convention which has been
    around since the first version of Unix in 1969</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 3: Test the newly compiled mysh</h2>
  <p>
    Before you go all out and set <span class="bash">mysh</span> as your
    default shell, you should test it out. Assuming that you're in the
    directory where you compiled it, start it up with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    ./mysh
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    You should now see your usual <span class="bash">bash</span> prompt
    replaced with
  <p>
  
  <pre>
    /home/yourname/mysh>
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    or whichever your current directory is. Try a few usual commands
    (<span class="bash">pwd</span>, <span class="bash">ls</span>,
    maybe even <span class="bash">bash</span>) and ensure that they do what
    they usually do. The special case of <span class="bash">cd</span> should
    print a message as to whether the directory change succeeded or failed.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 4: Copy mysh into /bin</h2>
  <p>
    Provided everything works fine with your compiled version of
    <span class="bash">mysh</span>, copy it into the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//bin">essential command binaries</a>
    directory with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    sudo cp mysh /bin
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    It should prompt you for a password as <span class="bash">sudo</span>
    usually does.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 5: Set the default shell to mysh for your user account</h2>
  <p>
    There are
    <a href="http://myotragusbalearicus.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/change-default-shell-in-ubuntu/">two
    main ways to change your default shell in Ubuntu</a>, but we'll do it
    "by hand" to fully illustrate what's going on. Open the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd_(file)">user accounts file</a>
    with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    sudo gedit /etc/passwd
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Note that you need root permission to edit
    <span class="bash">/etc/passwd</span>&mdash;<span class="heydummy">THIS
    FILE IS REALLY IMPORTANT!!!</span> Before you make any changes to it, you
    should make a backup&mdash;saving a copy with the name
    <span class="bash">passwd.bak</span> in the same directory should work
    fine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Look for the line that defines options for your user account. If you didn't
    add any other users to this machine after yours when you installed, it's
    probably on the last line, and it should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    yourname:x:1000:1000:Firstname Lastname,,,:/home/yourname:/bin/bash
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    The last of the colon-delimited options defines your default shell, the one
    that handles input and output via the terminal. It's probably
    <span class="bash">/bin/bash</span> (though it could also be
    <span class="bash">/bin/sh</span> or even
    <span class="bash">/bin/dash</span>, depending on possible exotic user
    settings&mdash;<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh">Debian has
    been changing things around recently with the system shell</a>). Change
    this option to <span class="bash">/bin/mysh</span> to set your default
    shell to <span class="bash">mysh</span>, save the file, log out, and log
    back in to execute the change.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 6: Observe that the change went through</h2>
  <p>
    To check if the change went through as planned, open a terminal window. If
    the prompt looks like it did when you tried out
    <span class="bash">mysh</span> in Step 3, congratulations!
  </p>
  
  <h2>BONUS Step 7: Check out the Easter Egg</h2>
  <p>
    Your new shell <span class="bash">mysh</span> has an Easter Egg that
    directly calls the new system call implemented in the
    <a href="http://my.cs.lmu.edu/~drowe2/ubuntu-kernel-howto/">aforementioned
    kernel mod</a>. To give it a try, pass the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    secret-system-call
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Like you did in the kernel mod tutorial, check
    <span class="bash">/var/log/kern.log</span>. (Note: you may have to change
    the macro <span class="bash">__NR_helloworld</span> to whatever your
    system call number for the new syscall ended up being in
    <span class="bash">mysh.c</span> and rebuild/reinstall to make it work!)
