    The Modern Lady or Gentleman's Guide to Building and Installing mysh on
    Ubuntu 11.10
  </h1>
  
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Computer or virtual machine running Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)
      <br/>(Preferably running the kernel mod described in
      <a href="http://my.cs.lmu.edu/~drowe2/ubuntu-kernel-howto/">
      The Modern Lady or Gentleman's Guide to Modifying, Building, and
      Installing a new Kernel for Ubuntu 11.10</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      The following should be a part of the Ubuntu 11.10 distribution, but you
      should check to make sure that they are present:
      <ol>
        <li>A browser of some kind</li>
        <li><span class="bash">git</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gcc</span></li>
        <li><span class="bash">gedit</span></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>root privileges</li>
    <li>An Internet connection (Still gotta say it...)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Step 1: Download the mysh source</h2>
  <p>
    Open the page at
    <a href="http://my.cs.lmu.edu/~drowe2/myshell/mysh.c">
    http://my.cs.lmu.edu/~drowe2/myshell/mysh.c</a>, which has the full source
    file for <span class="bash">mysh</span>. Save this file in a directory
    where you are allowed to build and execute it&mdash;for our purposes, let's
    save it in a new directory <span class="bash">~/mysh</span>, where
    <span class="bash">~</span> is your home directory.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Step 2: Compile mysh from source</h2>
  <p>
    Open up your terminal and <span class="bash">cd</span> to
    <span class="bash">~/mysh</span> (or wherever you saved the source file
    from Step 1). Build an executable with the name
    <span class="bash">mysh</span> with the following command:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
    gcc -o mysh mysh.c
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    Unlike when you perhaps built the modified kernel from source with
    <span class="bash">make</span>, here you use <span class="bash">gcc</span>
    alone. The combination of the argument and option
    <span class="bash">-o mysh</span> tell <span class="bash">gcc</span> to
    name the resulting executable <span class="bash">mysh</span>. Without this
    statement, the compiler will choose the name
    <span class="bash">a.out</span> by default,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out">a convention which has been
    around since the first version of Unix in 1969</a>.
